### Article 1
 -  Article name.
 - AI technologies — like police facial recognition — discriminate against
 people of colour

-  Reference or article citation.
 - Bailey, J., Burkell, J., & Steeves, V. (2020, August 24). AI technologies - like police facial recognition - discriminate against people of colour. https://theconversation.com/ai-technologies-like-police-facial-recognition-discriminate-against-people-of-colour-143227.

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - The article describes the potential racist issues with facial recognition algorithms. It provides a few personal accounts of discrimination based on this faulted technology and why exactly this technology has higher fail rates in identifying non-white individuals.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - The algorithms of this facial recognition technology used by the police force has a pre-existing bias; when the technology was created there was a failure to account for other important measures such as testing effectiveness with all people rather than lighter skinned individuals. Therefore, the technology has higher failure rates to identify people of color which is problematic because it leads to more accusations on completely innocent civilians based on their skin color.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - The article discusses a few instances of algorithms being discriminatory, but the manipulated data from the anecdote toward the beginning of the article is referring to facial recognition technology. This technology is used by the police force, as recently as January 2020, to identify potential criminals. The technology provided incorrect information, however, Robert Julian-Borchak Williams was still arrested. Therefore, the data is abused in such a way to identify and arrest individuals without there being proper care to ensure that the technology is completely effective.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - The facial recognition technology analyzes faces and matches their identifying features to others photos that have been collected through data provided from outside sources, such as social media.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - Everyone potentially stands something to lose with this form of analysis, as facial recognition without regulations is an extreme violation of privacy. However, in this specific instance, people of color have even more to lose from this because of the higher potential to being falsely accused of a crime that they did not commit.


### Article 2
 -  Article name.
 - Every step you take: why Google's plan to buy Fitbit has the ACCC's pulse racing

-  Reference or article citation.
 - Kemp, K. (2020, June 23). Every step you take: why Google's plan to buy Fitbit has the ACCC's pulse racing. https://theconversation.com/every-step-you-take-why-googles-plan-to-buy-fitbit-has-the-acccs-pulse-racing-141052.

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - The article describes the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's concerns regarding Google's potential acquisition of the fitness tracker company, Fitbit. It continues to elaborate on the ACCC's concerns of Google acquiring even more consumer data.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - Google acquiring more data, specifically the health data that Fitbit collects, increases the information they can use to track consumers. Since Google already has an incredibly extensive collection of consumer data, compiled from its other companies such as YouTube and Android, the acquisition of more intimate data is causation for more worry. Using health data, Google has no bounds as to what they cannot do; they can target consumers based on their specific health data, which in my opinion is incredibly unethical.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - Fitbit's health data, such as sleeping patterns, heart rate, active minutes, height and weight,  birth date, food logs, mobile number, precise location data at the very least. If a particular consumer elects to use Fitbit's other services, this can also include wellness goals and plans, calendar events, coach communications, period tracking, fertile times, ovulation schedule and other health symptoms.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - Since Fitbit is a wearable device, it tracks the bodily functions and any other data that a consumer would elect to give. Google's acquisition of Fitbit gives them the ability to analyze this data for their personal use or at the very least to add to their detailed consumer profiles.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - Google stands to gain an incredible amount from gaining Fitbit's data analysis logs by gaining a competitive edge by preventing competitors from accessing the data set and again also gives them more information to add to their extensively detailed consumer profiles. On the other hand, consumers have an incredible amount to lose in privacy and their own data freedom. Google's acquisition of this health information only increases the tight chokehold that they have on society.
