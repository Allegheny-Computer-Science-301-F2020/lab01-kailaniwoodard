### Article 1
 -  Article name.
 - AI technologies — like police facial recognition — discriminate against
 people of colour

-  Reference or article citation.
 - Bailey, J., Burkell, J., & Steeves, V. (2020, August 24). AI technologies - like police facial recognition - discriminate against people of colour. https://theconversation.com/ai-technologies-like-police-facial-recognition-discriminate-against-people-of-colour-143227.

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - The article describes the potential racist issues with facial recognition algorithms. It provides a few personal accounts of discrimination based on this faulted technology and why exactly this technology has higher fail rates in identifying non-white individuals.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - The algorithms of this facial recognition technology used by the police force has a pre-existing bias; when the technology was created there was a failure to account for other important measures such as testing effectiveness with all people rather than lighter skinned individuals. Therefore, the technology has higher failure rates to identify people of color which is problematic because it leads to more accusations on completely innocent civilians based on their skin color.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - The article discusses a few instances of algorithms being discriminatory, but the manipulated data from the anecdote toward the beginning of the article is referring to facial recognition technology. This technology is used by the police force, as recently as January 2020, to identify potential criminals. The technology provided incorrect information, however, Robert Julian-Borchak Williams was still arrested. Therefore, the data is abused in such a way to identify and arrest individuals without there being proper care to ensure that the technology is completely effective.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - The facial recognition technology analyzes faces and matches their identifying features to others photos that have been collected through data provided from outside sources, such as social media.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - Everyone potentially stands something to lose with this form of analysis, as facial recognition without regulations is an extreme violation of privacy. However, in this specific instance, people of color have even more to lose from this because of the higher potential to being falsely accused of a crime that they did not commit.
